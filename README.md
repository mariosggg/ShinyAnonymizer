ShinyAnonymizer: A Tool for Anonymizing Health Data

Processing and managing sensitive health data requires a high standard of security and privacy measures to ensure that all ethical and legal requirements are respected. Data anonymization is one of the key technologies to this purpose.However,the plethora and the complexity of the available anonymization techniques make it difficult for a non-expert to select and apply the appropriate technique. In this paper, we report on Shiny Database Anonymizer,a tool enabling the easy and flexible anonymization of available health data,providing access to state of the art anonymization techniques, incorporating also multiple data analysis visualization paradigms.In addition, a number of encryption and hashing techniques are presented.   


Features
